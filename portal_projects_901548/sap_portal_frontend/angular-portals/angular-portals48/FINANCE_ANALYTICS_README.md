2. **Aging Service** (`/api/aging/:lifnr`)
   - Retrieves aging analysis data
   - Categorizes records into aging buckets (Current, 30 Days, 60 Days, 90 Days, Over 90 Days)

3. **Memo Service** (`/api/memo/:lifnr`)
   - Fetches memo data including types (Credit/Debit) and amounts
   - Processes monthly trends and type breakdowns
